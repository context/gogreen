                                         <h2>GGF PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">GGF (“GGF,” “we,” “us”) respects individual privacy and values the confidence of donors, volunteers, employees, business partners and others. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) that we collect from donors, and volunteers both offline and online through our website located at www.gogreenfoundation.com  (the “Site”), as well as visitors of the Site.										  </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">BY USING THE SITE, OR BY PARTICIPATING IN GGF’S OFFLINE ACTIVITIES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page.  You can determine when this Agreement was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this Agreement. [NOTE:  IF WE INCLUDE THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, THE "LAST UPDATED" FUNCTION MUST BE ADDED TO THE ONLINE FORM OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF WE DON'T ADD THAT FUNCTION, THEN DELETE THE SENTENCE THAT BEGINS "You can determine. . . ." AND SUBSTITUTE THE FOLLOWING:  Any change in the terms of this Agreement will be posted promptly on this web page."]  Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site or participation in GGF’s offline activities following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.  The Site is controlled and operated by GGF from the United States, and is not intended to subject GGF to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. GGF does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">1. Definitions.
											  For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:
											  a“Agent” means any third party that uses Personally Identifiable Information provided by GGF to perform tasks on behalf of or at the instruction of GGF..
											  “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” or “Non-PII” is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal specific identifying information about you.											  </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII” means information that identifies you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, profile information and user name. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">“Young People” mean the young people (age 13-22) who participate in programs or activities promoted, sponsored or initiated by GGF.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">“You” means an individual who is involved in any way wth GGF, its activities or its events.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">“GGF” means GGF, its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups. 
											  “Partner Organization” means any third party with whom GGF collaborates in order to engage and support the Young People.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">2. What Types of Information Does GGF Collect From Me? GGF collects information from you.  GGF gathers two basic types of information: “Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII”) and “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” (or “Non-PII”).										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">a. Personally Identifiable Information. We endeavor to collect PII from you only when you voluntarily provide it to us. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to register to use the Site in order to connect with likeminded youth), we may require that you furnish PII. The types of PII that may be collected on the Site include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, venture information and venture ideas, personal interests as well as other information at your option, such as your gender, age, or donation payment information.
											  In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided offline, we may require that you furnish PII similar to that which may be collected on the Site.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit and interact with the Site, GGF and third parties with whom GGF has contracted to provide services to GGF may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII may be collected from sources such as server log files, cookies, pixel tags and aggregated information.											  </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">i. Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visit. IP addresses can be used to calculate Site usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and to administer the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">ii. Cookies. We and our service providers may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular web site. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">iii. Pixel Tags. We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site and to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.
											  iv. Aggregated Information. We may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">3. How Is Information Collected Online and Offline Used?
											  a. Personally Identifiable Information. GGF may use PII in the following ways:										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">i. Fulfillment of Requests. We use PII to fulfill any request you make at the time you provide the PII.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">ii. Legitimate Program and Operational Reasons. We may use PII for coordinating volunteers Young People, processing donations, meeting governmental reporting and records requirements, completing contracts and memoranda of understanding, maintaining accurate accounting information, performing research, supporting Young People through the process of designing and launching their activities, processing and distributing grants to Young People, providing ongoing opportunities and information to Young People, and maintaining contact information.</p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text"> iii. Background Checks. GGF also has policies designed to conduct background checks on individuals who interact with minors, such as a mentor or volunteer for whom GGF arranges direct, unsupervised interaction with minors.
											  iv. Administrative Communications. From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use PII to communicate with you about information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these e-mails.
											  v. Newsletters, Updates and Promotional Information. GGF may use PII to send updates, newsletters or other news regarding GGF. In most cases, GGF keeps individuals and organizations informed through periodic e-mails; however, in some cases, individuals and organizations may also receive materials and information via postal mail, fax or by telephone.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">vi. Online Profiles. If GGF offers Profile capabilities, you may post certain information and materials on your online “profile page” (your “Profile”). Please note that your Profile, including all PII available on your Profile, is viewable by other users. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, in your Profile. GGF IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">vii. Online Forums. GGF and/or our third party service provider(s) may make available through the Site interactive services (including without limitation, chat rooms, message boards, blogs and wikis) to which you are able to post information and materials (each, a “Forum”). Please note that any information you disclose in a Forum becomes public information, and may be available to other visitors to the Site and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting to a Forum, certain PII, such as your name, will be available for other users to view. Information regarding your activities in Forums is also available for view by other users. For example, other users may be able to view a list of all the postings you have made in all available Forums. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII, or any other information, in any Forum. GGF IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN FORUMS.</p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text"> viii. E-mail addresses and friend networks. GGF may offer the ability to invite new friends to join the Site and to add users to members’ friend networks. If so, GGF may store the e-mail addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend’s list of the member sending the invitation and also to send invitation reminders.  YOU WILL ONLY SEND INVITATIONS TO JOIN THE SITE TO RECIPIENTS WITH WHOM YOU HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP. You will NOT send invitations to join the site to (a) a purchased list of email addresses from ANY source no matter what that source claims, (b) distribution lists or mailing lists, i.e. email addresses that mail to more than one email address, or, (c) captured email addresses obtained by surfing the Internet or “scraping” web pages.
											  b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we (including our affiliates) may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII with third parties for any purpose.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">iix.  Anti-Spam Restriction. In accordance with the Rules of Conduct, you will not use our Site to make any vommunications which are unsolicited bulk advertising or promotional messages (“spam”), so-called “chain letters,” pyramid schemes, or make communications of a promotional nature other than through channels authorized by the Site. You may not harvest email addresses or instant messaging identifiers. Because the damage incurred by us in connection with spam campaigns may be difficult to ascertain, you agree to pay liquidated damages of USD$3 per individual recipient of spam messages transmitted under your account if you knowingly cause spam to be sent.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">4. How Does GGF Disclose Personally Identifiable Information?
											  a. Third Party Service Providers. We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to web site hosting, data analysis and other services of an administrative nature. We reserve the right to share PII about you with these third parties solely for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such services to GGF.
											  b. Assignment. In the event there is a change in the structure of GGF such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, GGF may, in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Site and collected offline, including without limitation, PII, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.
											  c. Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose PII about you, as we believe to be appropriate: (a) as permitted by applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms of Service; (d) to protect our operations or those of any affiliates; (e) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of GGF, its affiliates, you or others; and (f) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
											  d. GGF and Partner Organizations. GGF reserves the right to share PII about you with GGF and our Partner Organizations for the purpose of enabling these Partners to provide services such as those described in Section 3. For example, GGF staff may provide PII information about Young People to GGF program staff at GGF so that GGF may send invitations for a community-building event it is hosting for Young People. GGF may provide PII to a partner organization in order that the partner organization can provide seed funding directly to teams.of Young People participating in GGF sponsored, guided or approved activities.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">5. Notice Regarding PII about Children’s Information. GGF does not knowingly use its web site to collect PII from children under 13 years of age.											  </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">6. Notice Regarding Security. We seek to have security measures and tools in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security in an online or offline environment. As a result, we cannot, and do not, guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site or that we store on our or our agents’ systems and facilities. Please do not send sensitive information to us via our web site or e-mail. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your Profile page has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with “Contacting Us,” as described below. </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">7. Third-Party Sites. The Site may contain links to third-party web sites. These linked sites are not under GGF's control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by GGF. If you provide any PII through any such third party web site, your interaction will occur on such third-party's web site (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.										    </p>
											<p class="disclaimer_text">8. Access and Correction. Upon request, GGF will grant individuals reasonable access to PII about them that GGF maintains.
