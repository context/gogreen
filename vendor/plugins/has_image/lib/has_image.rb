# = HasImage
#
# HasImage allows you to very easily attach images to a Rails model. For some
# more basic info on what it does, please see its {project
# page}[http://github.com/norman/has_image] on GitHub.
#
# Install HasImage by using Ruby Gems:
#
#  sudo gem install has_image
#
# To use HasImage in your project, you must add a varchar column to your
# model. By default, this column should be named "has_image_file," though you
# may easily change this. For option defaults, see
# HasImage#default_options_for and ClassMethods#has_image.
#
# == Basic Examples
##
# Uses all default options. This works, but is likely not what you need.
#
#  class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
#    has_image
#  end
#
# Resize the uploaded image to 800x800 and create a 150x150 thumbnail.
#
#   has_image :resize_to "800x800", :thumbnails => {:square => "150x150"}
#
# Resize the image and set a max file size to 4 megabytes.
#
#   has_image :resize_to "100x150", :max_size => 4.megabytes
#
# == Some slightly more advanced examples
#
# === Localizing HasImage
#
#  has_image :invalid_image_message => "No se puede procesar la imagen."
#
# === Using has_image with Capistrano
#
# When deploying using Capistrano, you will likely want to keep images
# under a "system" directory so that newly deployed versions have access
# to them:
#
#   has_image :resize_to => "150x150",
#     :thumbnails => {
#       :square => "75x75",
#     },
#     :base_path => File.join(Rails.root, 'public', 'system')
#
# === Testing with HasImage:
#
# If you want your tests to actually run the image processing, you should
# make sure your tests write the image files somewhere outside your public
# directory. Add something like this to your config/environments/test.rb:
#
#   config.after_initialize do
#     MyClass.has_image_options[:base_path] = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, "tmp") 
#   end
#
# If you want to stub out calls to has_image so that your tests don't do
# the (slow) image processing, here's an example using Test::Unit and
# Mocha:
#
#   def setup
#     Photo.any_instance.stubs(:image_data=).returns(true)
#     Photo.any_instance.stubs(:install_images).returns(true)
#     Photo.any_instance.stubs(:image_data_valid?).returns(true)
#   end
#

    # === Options
    #
    # *  <tt>:resize_to</tt> - Dimensions to resize to. This should be an ImageMagick {geometry string}[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#resize]. Fixed sizes are recommended.
    # *  <tt>:thumbnails</tt> - A hash of thumbnail names and dimensions. The dimensions should be ImageMagick {geometry strings}[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#resize]. Fixed sized are recommended.
    # *  <tt>:auto_generate_thumbnails</tt> - Flag to indicate whether to automatically generate thumbnails when the image_data changes (e.g. on create). If you set this to false, your application code needs to take care of generating thumbnails, e.g. using +#generate_thumbnail+
    # *  <tt>:delete</tt> - Flag to indicate if the images should be deleted from the storage (e.g. the filesystem) when the record is destroyed.
    # *  <tt>:min_size</tt> - Minimum file size allowed. It's recommended that you set this size in kilobytes.
    # *  <tt>:max_size</tt> - Maximum file size allowed. It's recommended that you set this size in megabytes.
    # *  <tt>:base_path</tt> - Where to install the images.
    # *  <tt>:path_prefix</tt> - Where to install the images, relative to basepath.
    # *  <tt>:convert_to</tt> - An ImageMagick format to convert images to.
    # *  <tt>:output_quality</tt> - Image output quality passed to ImageMagick.
    # *  <tt>:invalid_image_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image data can't be processed.
    # *  <tt>:image_too_small_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image file is too small. You should ideally set this to something that tells the user what the minimum is.
    # *  <tt>:image_too_big_message</tt> - The message that will be shown when the image file is too big. You should ideally set this to something that tells the user what the maximum is.
